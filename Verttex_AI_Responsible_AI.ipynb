At the same time, as an early-stage technology, its evolving capabilities and uses create potential for misapplication, misuse, and unintended or unforeseen consequences. Large language models can generate output that you don't expect, including text that's offensive, insensitive, or factually incorrect.\n",

Given these risks and complexities, the PaLM API is designed with Google's AI Principles in mind. However, it is important for developers to understand and test their models to deploy safely and responsibly. To aid developers, the Generative AI Studio has built-in content filtering, and the PaLM API has safety attribute scoring to help customers test Google's safety filters and define confidence thresholds that are right for their use case and business.

        "Language models may provide inconsistent service quality to different users. For example, text generation might not be as effective for some dialects or language varieties due to underrepresentation in the training data. Performance may be worse for non-English languages or English language varieties with less representation.\n",
        "Fairness benchmarks and subgroups: Google Research's fairness analyses of the PaLM API do not provide an exhaustive account of the various potential risks. For instance, we focus on biases along gender, race, ethnicity and religion axes, but perform the analysis only on the English language data and model outputs.1\n",

        "Limited Domain Expertise: The PaLM API may lack the depth of knowledge required to provide accurate and detailed responses on highly specialized or technical topics, leading to superficial or incorrect information. For specialized, complex use cases, the PaLM API should be tuned on domain-specific data, and there must be meaningful human supervision in contexts with the potential to materially impact individual rights.\n",

        "Length and structure of inputs and outputs: The PaLM API has a maximum input token limit of 8k and output token limit of 1k. If the input or output exceeds this limit our safety classifiers will not be applied, which could ultimately lead to poor model performance. While the PaLM API is designed to handle a wide range of text formats, their performance can be affected if the input data has an unusual or complex structure.\n",
